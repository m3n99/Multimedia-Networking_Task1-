Activities (1): Apply DCT to an image
Objective: To visualize the importants of applying DCT to an image by changing the lest important coeeficnets to zero. 
Tasks:
1) Read an image into a matrix 
2) Apply 2D-DCT to the matrix
3) Convert the last K coeffcients to zero (multiply the last (in zigzag scan) DCT-Coefficients by zeros while all other coeeficients are left the same).
4) Apply inverse 2D-DCT transform to the modified DCT coefficients. 
5) Display the recosntracted image.
6) Repreat the procedure from 3 to 5 while changing the vale of K.
7)  Comment on your findings. 29 Multimedia Networking
